# transit-julia

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between applications written in different languages. This library provides support for marshalling Transit data to/from [Julia](http://julialang.org).

* [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of the Transit specification it supports.

Currently on the JSON formats are implemented.
MessagePack is **not** implemented yet. 

_NOTE: Transit is a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback. As a result, while Transit is a great option for transferring data between applications, it should not yet be used for storing data durably over time. This recommendation will change when the specification is complete._

## Usage

Reading data with transit-julia involves...

```julia
TBD
```

Writing is similar:

```julia
TBD
```


## Default Type Mapping

Really this is all TBD at this point.

| Semantic Type | write accepts | read produces |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| null| nil | nil |
| string| string | string |
| boolean | bool| bool |
| integer, signed 64 bit| any signed or unsiged int type | int64 |
| floating pt decimal| float32 or float64 | float64 |
| bytes| []byte | []byte |
| keyword | transit.Keyword | transit.Keyword |
| symbol | transit.Symbol | transit.Keyword
| arbitrary precision decimal| big.Float | big.Float |
| arbitrary precision integer| big.Int | big.Int |
| point in time | time.Time | time.Time |
| point in time RFC 33339 | - | time.Time |
| u| github.com/pborman/uuid UUID| github.com/pborman/uuid UUID|
| uri | net/url URL | net/url URL |
| char | rune | rune |
| special numbers | As defined by math NaN and math.Inf() | TBD
| array | arrays or slices | []interface{} |
| map | map[interface{}]interface{} | map[interface{}]interface{} | 
| set |  transit.Set | transit.Set |
| list | container/list List | container/list List |
| map w/ composite keys |  transit.CMap |  transit.CMap |
| link | TBD | TBD |
